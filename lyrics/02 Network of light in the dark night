You’re always tracking me.
But it's not me.
It’s a nameless ghost from the darkest depths of the ocean.
I’ve always walked beside you.
But you never notice me.
The ghost could cause a poltergeist
But it’s not me
It’s not me

Telepathy
Poltergeist

Man-made disaster
Natural Disaster
Sympathy
Wind
Shuffling complex complex.
Here, chaos for chaos.
Shaken down, shaken down

I've talked to you
You never answer me
Instead, the ghost get the answer
I wonder if you were a ghost too
‘Cause we never say hello to you
This is something strange for me
But not for you?
Intention, Carelessness, Blindness, Habit, Reflex
Unawareness, Discipline, Deafness, Reason, Thought
Painless, Expressionless, Callous, Mute
Shuffling complex complex.
Here, chaos for chaos.
Shaken down, shaken down

Such a lovely place, We sink?
The hotter coldest place we roam every day
Such a lovely culture, Solid gold?
The wind cut through fake cultural barriers 
In virtual reality

In the end
Why not smile and talk to you?
Why not meet somewhere and sometime?
Why not?
It's time to get out of here
To seeing the beautiful world with you
Still thinking in the submarine cable
Why not?
Get out of here
In the end
